Unified Pose Estimation for Multi-Camera Systems Using Point and Line Correspondences

This is the official C++ implementation for our paper, "Unified Pose Estimation for Multi-Camera Systems Using Point and Line Correspondences", submitted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL).

This project addresses the Non-Perspective-n-Point-and-Line (NPnPL) problem for generalized multi-camera systems. Our algorithm presents a unified framework that leverages both point and line correspondences to accurately and robustly estimate the pose (rotation and translation) of a multi-camera system.
