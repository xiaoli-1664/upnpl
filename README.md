# Unified Pose Estimation for Multi-Camera Systems Using Point and Line Correspondences

This repository contains the official implementation of the method proposed in our paper:

> **Unified Pose Estimation for Multi-Camera Systems Using Point and Line Correspondences**  
> Submitted to *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)*, 2025.

## üåê Overview

We present a unified and efficient approach to estimate the full 6-DoF pose of a multi-camera system from 2D‚Äì3D point and line correspondences. Our method supports arbitrary camera configurations and localization using points, lines, or a combination of both.
